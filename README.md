# personal_web
My personal website with a golang server and simple html pages. Future work would be to visualize my projects into this site.

# Status
Currently working with a BASIC page.

# To run
Make sure you have bazel installed and run the following command:

```
bazel run server
```

This will bring up a local server which you can access at localhost:8080
